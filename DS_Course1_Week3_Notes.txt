The Data Scientist's Toolbox - Week 3
-------------------------------------

Types of questions
	Descriptive
		Describe set of data
		first kind performed 
		Commonly census
		census.gov
	Exploratory
		Find relationships / new connections 
		Useful for defining future studies
		Should Not used for generalizing predicting
		Correlation does not imply causation
	Inferential
		Use small data samples to say something about bigger 
		The goal of statistics models
		Estimate quantity 
		Air Pollution Control on Life Expectancy (545 counties)
	Predictive
		Use object data on some to predict values for another object
		If X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y
		Target predicts pregnancy by purchases
	Causal
		What happens to one variable when you change another
		Randomized studies to identify causation
		Averages, gold standard
	Mechanistic
		Understand the exact changes in vars that lead to changes in other vars for individual objects
		incredibly hard to infer except in simple situations
		Physical/Eng
		Measurment error

	Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables belonging to a set of items
	Variables - A measurement or a characteristic of an item
	Qualitative: country, sex, treatment
	Quantitative: height, weight, blood pressure

	data.gov

	Data is the second most important thing
	The most important thing is the question
	Data will often limit or enable the questions
	Having data cant save you if you dont have a question

	Big or small you need the right data
